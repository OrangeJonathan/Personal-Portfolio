    description: "PokeRacer is a web application/game that I made in the third semester of my study. It was an introduction to fullstack development for me. Using Vue.js for my front-end and Java in the back-end. Using websockets I was able to make a game where it is possible to race against eachother in guessing Pokémon. Besides this it's also possible to chat with eachother to flex on your Pokémon guessing skills. View the code on Github: <a href='https://github.com/OrangeJonathan/S3DB-IP-PokemonRace-BackEnd'> Backend </a> - <a href='https://github.com/OrangeJonathan/S3DB-IP-PokemonRace-FrontEnd'> Frontend </a>",
    details: "During this project, I learned a lot about fullstack development, including how to use Vue.js for the front-end and Java for the back-end. I also gained experience with websockets, which allowed me to create a real-time multiplayer game. This project was a great introduction to fullstack development and helped me understand the importance of communication between the front-end and back-end. <br /> During this project I used the PokeAPI in order to get Pokémon data like sprites, names and generation. Besides this I also had to store the data of the users in a database, for this I used MySQL, which thought me many different lessons in good and bad practices within databases. Luckily I was able to use Hibernate to make the connection between the database and the back-end easier."

    description: "Medieval Fortress is a game I made with a friend of mine. The game was created within 6 to 7 weeks during the fourth semester of my study. It's a tower defense game where you have to defend your 'castle' from animals that are possessed by an evil wizard. <br /> The game is made within Unity3D and is playable on  <a href='https://biiiy.itch.io/medievalfortress'> itch.io </a>. View the code on <a href='https://github.com/OrangeJonathan/MedievalFortress'> Github </a>",
    details: "This project taught me a lot about game development, particularly in Unity3D. Working with a friend, we were able to create a fun and challenging tower defense game. I learned about game mechanics, level design, and how to work effectively in a team. This project also helped me improve my problem-solving skills as we encountered and overcame various challenges during development."

    description: "The YawVR chair is a chair which is able to move with certain actions in game. During this project my team and I worked for Enversed Studios in order to develop an interactive game to be played in their VR center. The game is about exploring a planet whilst you are in the YawVR chair. During the project me and my team were instructed to build the game in Unreal Engine, but with the limitations of the YawVR chair we had to use Unreal4 instead of the newer Unreal5.",
    details: "Working on the YawVR project was an incredible experience. I learned about VR development and how to integrate hardware with software. Developing a game for the YawVR chair required us to think creatively and adapt to the limitations of the hardware. This project also gave me the opportunity to work with Unreal Engine, which was a valuable learning experience."

    description: "Mars Runner is an endless runner game. In this game you are on Mars and you have to evade obstacles. I used Assets from <a href='https://Kenney.nl'> Kenney.nl </a>. This game was created by me in Unity3D to get more knowledge about the Engine and Optimizing games. The game is playable on my <a href='https://orangeplayah.itch.io/mars-runner'> itch.io </a>. View the code on <a href='https://github.com/OrangeJonathan/MarsRunner'> Github </a>",
    details: "Mars Runner was a solo project that helped me improve my skills in Unity3D. I focused on optimizing the game for better performance and creating engaging gameplay mechanics. This project also allowed me to experiment with different assets and learn more about game design. It was a great opportunity to apply what I had learned in previous projects and continue to grow as a game developer."

In this game you try to solve puzzles by using the ability to 'Swap Bodies', so you switch between different characters, with different abilities, in order to overcome challenges. The game is playable on <a href='https://orangeplayah.itch.io/mindswap'> Itch.io </a>",
    details: "MindSwap was inspired by the Portal series and challenged me to create unique puzzle mechanics. I learned about character abilities and how to design levels that require players to think strategically. This project also helped me improve my skills in Unity3D and understand the importance of playtesting and iteration in game development."
